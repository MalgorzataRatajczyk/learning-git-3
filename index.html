	<h1>The Sound of Silence</h1>
	<h2>Simon & Garfunkel</h2>
	<p class="first">Hello darkness, my old friend,
	I've come to talk with you again,
	Because a vision softly creeping,
	Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
	And the vision that was planted in my brain
	Still remains
	Within the sound of silence.</p>
	<p class="second">In restless dreams I walked alone 
	Narrow streets of cobblestone,
	'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
	I turned my collar to the cold and damp
	When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
	That split the night
	And touched the sound of silence</p>
	<p class="third">
	And in the naked light I saw
	Ten thousand people, maybe more.
	People talking without speaking,
	People hearing without listening,
	People writing songs that voices never share 
	And no one dared 
	Disturb the sound of silence.</p>
