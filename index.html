	<h1>The Sound of Silence</h1>
	<h2>Simon & Garfunkel</h2>
	<p class="first">Hello darkness, my old friend,
	I've come to talk with you again,
	Because a vision softly creeping,
	Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
	And the vision that was planted in my brain
	Still remains
	Within the sound of silence.</p>
	<p class="second">In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence</p>
